Machine learning and data analysis. 4th year

## Short description
This dataset pertains to heart disease in the United States and its risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking. These factors can lead to serious consequences, including heart attacks and myocardial infarctions. Therefore, it is important to create a model for predicting the risk of heart disease before symptoms occur.

## Usage
1. Activate python venv
